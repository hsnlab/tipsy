#+TITLE: TIPSY configuration guide

TIPSY relies on a high-level main configuration file to perform reliable
and reproducible benchmarks. The key to the flexibility of TIPSY is that
this configuration allows to define a wide range of different tests, from
stability tests to scalability and robustness measurements, using minimal
configuration on the side of the user.

A sample configuration for TIPSY is given below.

#+BEGIN_SRC javascript
{
    "benchmark": [
        {
            "id": "test1",
            "scale": "outer",
            "pipeline": {
		"core": 1,
		"name": "mgw",
                "user": [4,8],
                "bst": 1,
                "server": 2,
                "rate-limit": 10000,
                "nhop": 4,
                "fakedrop": false,
                "fluct-user": 0,

The general rule is that when a configuration parameter is omitted, TIPSY
chooses a sane built-in default.

* The =benchmark= section

The configuration defines a main =benchmark= section that defines a list of
benchmarks to be run. This allows to request multiple TIPSY benchmarks in a
single configuration.

Each benchmark in turn defines the following subsections:

- an unnamed "general" section that gives the overall settings for the
  benchmark, like name, scaling mode, etc.
- =pipeline=: pipeline-specific settings
- =traffic=: traffic generator settings
- =sut=: SUT settings
- =tester=: Tester settings

* The =pipeline= section

Pipeline specific settings. The =pipeline= section has a mandatory =name=
parameter that defines the name for the pipeline to be configured for the
benchmark. The =core= parameter defines the number of CPU
cores/workers. For other specific settings consult the docs and JSON schema
of the individual pipelines.

* The =traffic= section

Parameters for the traffic trace that will be fed to the pipeline by the
Tester. This section might contain the below parameters.

- =pkt-size=: packet size [byte]
- =pkt-num=: number of packets
- =dir=:
  - =uplink=: evaluate the upstream datapath
  - =downlink=: evaluate the downstream datapath
  - =bidir=: run test in both directions
- =thread=: number of requested processing CPU threads. 0 means all of the
  available cores.
- =ascii=: dump generated packets in human readable ASCII form

* The =tester= section

Parameters for the Tester, among others, the traffic generator backend to
be used for insert the traffic trace into the SUT and other Tester specific
settings.

- =type=: packet generator for the Tester (=moongen= or =moongen-rfc2544=)
- =test-time=: runtime in seconds
- =moongen-cmd=: absolute path of the MoonGen executable
- =uplink_port= and =downlink_port=: port name ('eth1') or pci addr for
  DPDK ('0000:0b:00.0') or DPDK port number (in case of moongen, e.g., '0').
- =core=: number of CPU cores to use
- =setup_script=: absolute path of your custom Tester setup script. Useful
  for e.g. automating DPDK interface configuration.
- =teardown_script=: absolute path of your custom Tester teardown script

* The =sut= section

Settings for the System-Under-Test (SUT).

- =type=: SUT implementation (=bess=, =ovs=, etc.)
- =hostname=: hostname that can be used to ssh into SUT without a password
  as 'ssh hostname'.  Edit ~/.ssh/config for more complicated scenarios.
  See man page: ssh_config (5)
- =bess-dir=: a directory on SUT in which BESS is installed
- =tipsy-dir=: a directory on SUT in which TIPSY is installed
- =erfs-dir=: a directory on SUT in which ERFS is installed
- =t4p4s-dir=: a directory on SUT in which T4P4S is installed
- =uplink_port= and =downlink_port=: port name ('eth1') or pci addr for
  DPDK ('0000:0b:00.0') or DPDK port number (in case of moongen, e.g., '0').
- =setup_script=: absolute path of your custom SUT setup script. This
  script will run on the SUT before starting a measurement
- =teardown_script=: absolute path of your custom SUT teardown script. This
  script will run on SUT after ending a measurement
- =coremask=: hexadecimal coremask as string.  Supported by bess, ovs,
  t4p4s, vpp.  Required by t4p4as. (note: this defines the availabilty of
  the cores.  The actual number of cores is defined by pipeline.core)
- =portmask=: hexadecimal portmask as string.  Supported by t4p4s.
  Required by t4p4as.
- =uplink-vpp-interface=: uplink VPP Interface name. Required by VPP.
- =downlink-vpp-interface=: downlink VPP Interface name. Required by VPP.

* The =default= section

The default section provides an interface to apply benchmark
parameters for every benchmark.

* The =visualize= section

The visualize section can be used to configure plots of the captured data.
- =type=: The type of the plot. (=simple=, =table=, =contour=, =USL=)
- =x-axis=: The JSON Path in dot notation to the field in the result.json that is used on the x-axis
- =y-axis=: The JSON Path in dot notation to the field in the result.json that is used on the y-axis
- =z-axis=: The JSON Path in dot notation to the field in the result.json that is used on the z-axis
- =group-by=: The JSON Path in dot notation to the field by which the data is grouped
- =filter=: A mongoquery to filter the results before collecting the data for x-,y- and z-axis 
- =title=: The tite for the plot
- =axis-type=: One of the axis types defined by matplotlib
- =aggregate=: Mongo aggregation pipeline for more complex data filtering
